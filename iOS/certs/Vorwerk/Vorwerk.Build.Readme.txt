Certificate Path in SVN
-----------------------

Developer
--------
Certificate: 			<ROOT>/trunk/Smartphone/iOS/certs/Vorwerk/Beta/DEV/vorwerk_dev.p12
Provisioning Profile	<ROOT>/trunk/Smartphone/iOS/certs/Vorwerk/Beta/DEV/Vorwerk_Beta_DEV.mobileprovision

Distribution
------------
Certificate: 			<ROOT>/trunk/Smartphone/iOS/certs/Vorwerk/Beta/DEV/vorwerk_beta_dist.p12
Provisioning Profile	<ROOT>/trunk/Smartphone/iOS/certs/Vorwerk/Beta/DEV/Vorwerk_Beta_PROD.mobileprovision


Below instructions are to build the Vorwerk developer build but same steps can be used to sign using the distribution certificate as well

Install Certificate
-------------------
- Install the certificate on your Mac machine. 
	- Double click on  "vorwerk_dev.p12", It will ask you for the password, please enter "v0rw3rk!@#"
- Install provisioning profile
    - Double click on Vorwerk_Beta_DEV.mobileprovision

Build Instructions
-------------------

- cd to "build" directory
- Ensure "build_cleaning_robot.sh" is executable. If not please run the following command
  $chmod a+x build_cleaning_robot.sh
- Now run the following command to build the Vorwerk Developer build
$./build_cleaning_robot.sh -b dev -p vorwerk


If everything is setup correctly, it should build and generate the "CleaningRobotApp_Vorwerk_Dev.ipa" file in the parent directory of "build" folder

Whenever you add new devices in provisioning profile, you need to install the new provisioning profile and also update the respective ant build xml
e.g.; For Vorwerk Dev its "build_vorwerk_dev.xml" and update with the new UUID of the provisioning profile

You can see the "UUID" of the provisioning profile by open the provisioning profile in text editor.

We will update the build script shortly to automatically take the UUID from provisioning profile. (You would need to provide the provisioning profile path)
